Aggregating reports from the Traffic Automation System (TAS) will allow authorities and stakeholders to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs), understand trends in traffic violations, and evaluate the systemâ€™s effectiveness in improving traffic management. Below are examples of aggregated reports that could be generated from the data collected, organized by specific focus areas:

1. Violation Report
Purpose: Track violations across different traffic types (motorcyclists, cyclists, vehicles) and understand trends in rule-breaking.
Key Metrics:
Total number of violations detected
Breakdown of violations by type (e.g., red-light jumping, speeding, not wearing helmets)
Violation rate by location (hotspots for violations)
Violation rate by time of day/week (peak violation times)
Number of repeat offenders
Fines generated from violations
Sample Report:
Violation Type	Total Violations	Location	Peak Time	Repeat Offenders	Fines Generated
Red-light Jumping	1,500	Intersection A	5:00 PM - 7:00 PM	30%	$15,000
Speeding	1,200	Intersection B	8:00 AM - 10:00 AM	25%	$12,000
Not Wearing Helmet	800	Intersection C	6:00 AM - 8:00 AM	15%	$8,000

2. Traffic Flow Report
Purpose: Analyze the overall flow of traffic and identify areas with heavy congestion or inefficient flow.
Key Metrics:
Average speed of vehicles and motorcyclists
Traffic volume per intersection
Peak traffic hours
Impact of signal timing adjustments
Lane occupancy (for motorcyclists and cyclists)
Sample Report:
Location	Average Speed	Traffic Volume (vehicles/hour)	Peak Hours	Signal Timing Adjustment
Intersection A	25 mph	1,000	4:00 PM - 6:00 PM	Increased green light time
Intersection B	30 mph	800	7:00 AM - 9:00 AM	No change
Intersection C	15 mph	1,200	3:00 PM - 5:00 PM	Extended signal cycles

3. Rider Behavior Analysis
Purpose: Understand rider behavior (motorcyclists and cyclists) in terms of rule compliance, frequency of violations, and overall safety.
Key Metrics:
Percentage of riders wearing helmets
Frequency of speed violations by riders
Time spent in dedicated motorcycle or bicycle lanes
Rider compliance with traffic signals
Number of accidents involving riders
Sample Report:
Rider Type	Helmet Usage (%)	Speeding Violations (%)	Lane Discipline (%)	Accidents Involving Riders	Total Riders
Motorcyclists	75%	20%	90%	15	1,200
Cyclists	85%	12%	80%	5	600

4. Traffic Signal Efficiency Report
Purpose: Measure the effectiveness of dynamic traffic signal adjustments based on real-time traffic data.
Key Metrics:
Average wait times at signals
Reduction in congestion due to dynamic signal adjustments
Effectiveness of traffic light synchronization (across multiple intersections)
Number of traffic signal faults or errors
Sample Report:
Location	Average Wait Time	Signal Adjustment Impact (%)	Traffic Congestion Reduction (%)	Signal Faults
Intersection A	2 minutes	30%	25%	1
Intersection B	3 minutes	20%	10%	0
Intersection C	1 minute	40%	35%	0

5. Revenue and Fine Report
Purpose: Track the financial aspect of the system, including fines and penalties collected due to traffic violations.
Key Metrics:
Total revenue generated from fines
Breakdown of fines by violation type
Revenue per location or intersection
Percentage of fines paid vs. outstanding
Sample Report:
Violation Type	Fines Issued	Revenue Generated	Outstanding Fines (%)
Red-light Jumping	1,500	$15,000	5%
Speeding	1,200	$12,000	10%
Not Wearing Helmet	800	$8,000	8%

6. Public Awareness Campaign Effectiveness Report
Purpose: Measure the impact of public awareness and educational campaigns on rider behavior.
Key Metrics:
Change in violation rates post-campaign
Engagement with awareness content (e.g., social media, apps)
Surveys or feedback indicating public perception of the campaign
Sample Report:
Campaign Type	Pre-Campaign Violations	Post-Campaign Violations	Change in Violations (%)	Engagement Rate (%)
Helmet Safety Campaign	500	350	-30%	60%
Speeding Awareness	1,000	850	-15%	45%
Lane Discipline Education	800	600	-25%	50%

7. Infrastructure Development Report
Purpose: Analyze the impact of dedicated lanes for motorcycles, cyclists, and general infrastructure improvements on traffic flow.
Key Metrics:
Traffic flow before and after infrastructure changes
Reduction in violations in newly designed lanes
Utilization rates of new infrastructure
Sample Report:
Infrastructure Change	Before Traffic Flow (vehicles/hour)	After Traffic Flow (vehicles/hour)	Violations Before	Violations After
Dedicated Motorcycle Lane	1,000	1,200	50	20
Bicycle Lane Creation	600	800	30	15

Conclusion
Aggregating these reports allows authorities to gain a comprehensive view of traffic management performance and rider behavior, providing actionable insights to optimize traffic flow, reduce violations, and improve public safety. The data-driven approach can identify hotspots for violations, predict trends in rider behavior, and evaluate the impact of policy changes such as new lanes or awareness campaigns. These reports not only help in real-time decision-making but also provide long-term insights for infrastructure planning and public education.
